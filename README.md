# Matt-and-Ari-EC
Yeah, it definitely is, but I understand why Klaus thought it would work for this. It took me a little while to figure it out but if you go to the EC, click the README.md file that is in blue, and then click the pen/"Edit this file" icon on the right then you should be able to just copy and paste the story in and then you just have to click "commit changes" on the bottom.
